### Research-Worthy Points

The problem of product identification in the context of software vulnerability management, especially when it comes to
open-source software, presents significant challenges. The complexity arises not only from the sheer number of different
identification schemes like CPE, PURL, CSAF Product, and MSRC Product but also from inconsistencies within these
systems. These inconsistencies manifest in various ways, from discrepancies in versioning across ecosystems to the use
of different naming conventions and standards by vendors. Each of these issues introduces friction in matching
vulnerabilities with the correct software products, which can lead to missed vulnerabilities or false positives, both of
which pose major risks to security.

A deeper examination of these existing identification formats, while already familiar to you through your experience at
metaeffekt, is necessary to understand why they fail to deliver an ideal solution. Existing research offers several
insights into dependency management and product identification, including the importance of interoperability between
different systems. The concept of using machine learning and data matching techniques, such as those explored in the
realm of entity resolution and data integration, could help address these challenges. Moreover, a closer look at how
versioning is handled in the context of open-source software could provide insights into how mismatched versions between
ecosystems might be reconciled. Additionally, ontologies and taxonomies could be used to better model relationships
between products and versions, allowing for more sophisticated correlation methods.

From a practical standpoint, there is also room for innovation in how we approach data formats for manual correction.
The current "Correlation YAML" format, though useful, is far from perfect, as it still requires considerable human
intervention to address mismatches and inaccuracies. There may be a potential opportunity to enhance this format or
develop a new approach that combines the best of existing standards with a more robust method of handling relationships
between products, versions, and vendors.

The challenge is not just about creating an improved correlation format, but also about developing a system that can
scale and be adaptable to the real-world complexities that arise when working with different software ecosystems. This
includes dealing with legacy systems, inconsistencies in how vulnerabilities are reported, and the constantly evolving
nature of software dependencies.

### Expanded Plan

The aim of the thesis is to propose a new system for product identification, one that could help resolve existing issues
with mapping products to vulnerabilities. The first major section would involve a detailed analysis of current product
identification formats. While these are already well known, a deeper dive into their shortcomings from an academic and
practical perspective would set the stage for understanding the most pressing issues in vulnerability management.

The second section would focus on the theoretical side of the problem, exploring research on how best to identify and
correlate products. This includes a thorough review of existing literature on dependency management, data matching
algorithms, and the challenges of working with versions and naming conventions. Specific attention should be given to
how the academic community has dealt with interoperability between different systems, as well as the use of ontologies
and taxonomies in related fields. This provides the background needed to propose a novel solution.

Next, you would move on to crafting your new product identification system, taking into account the practical realities
you and your team face at metaeffekt. The goal here is not only to propose a theoretical solution but to create
something that can be implemented in the real world. This could involve proposing a new format, refining the existing "
Correlation YAML" system, or even combining elements of multiple formats to create a more adaptable and accurate method
of identification.

Finally, your thesis would conclude by exploring the potential impact of your proposed system, assessing how it could
address the challenges identified in the earlier sections and laying the groundwork for future improvements. This would
include considering how your solution could evolve as new vulnerabilities are discovered, new identification formats
emerge, and software ecosystems continue to grow.

### Research Questions

One of the key research questions guiding this thesis is: **How can software product identification systems be improved
to ensure better correlation of vulnerabilities across different formats and ecosystems?** A related question is: **What
are the specific challenges faced by existing identification systems, and how can they be addressed by new methods of
version handling and product relationship modeling?**

Another crucial area of inquiry is: **How can manual intervention be reduced in vulnerability management systems,
particularly in relation to mismatched or inconsistent product identifiers?** This question ties directly to the
practical challenges you encounter with the "Correlation YAML" format and aims to uncover ways in which automation and
new formats can address human error and inconsistencies.

### Abstracts

**Abstract 1:** This thesis explores the challenges associated with software product identification in the context of
vulnerability management, focusing on the limitations of existing formats like CPE, PURL, CSAF Product, and MSRC
Product. It critically evaluates these identification systems and proposes a new, more flexible solution that addresses
the key issues of versioning inconsistencies, naming discrepancies, and relationship modeling between products. Through
an extensive review of the literature on dependency management, versioning practices, and data matching algorithms, the
thesis introduces a novel approach to product identification that integrates these insights into a practical, scalable
solution. By improving the existing "Correlation YAML" format or developing a new system entirely, this work aims to
reduce manual intervention in vulnerability correlation and create a more robust system for managing software
vulnerabilities across diverse ecosystems.

**Abstract 2:** The increasing complexity of managing software vulnerabilities across open-source ecosystems has
highlighted the need for more accurate and interoperable product identification systems. This thesis examines the state
of current identification formats and their shortcomings, particularly in handling versioning and product relationships.
Drawing on existing research in the fields of dependency management, versioning, and data integration, it proposes a
refined product identification system capable of bridging gaps between disparate formats and reducing human error. By
leveraging advanced techniques in data matching and incorporating relationship models, this research aims to create a
solution that enhances the accuracy and scalability of vulnerability management, ultimately contributing to the security
of software ecosystems.
