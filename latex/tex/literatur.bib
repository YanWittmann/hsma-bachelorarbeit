    abstractNote = {In this manuscript, we propose a graph-based approach for identification of vulnerable asset configurations via Common Platform Enumeration matching. The approach consists of a graph model and insertion procedure that is able to represent and store information about CVE vulnerabilities and different configurations of CPE-classified asset components. These building blocks are accompanied with a search query in Gremlin graph traversal language that is able to find all vulnerable pairs of CVEs and asset configurations in a single traversal, as opposed to a conventional brute-force approach.},

    abstractNote = {In this paper, we analyze the Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) dictionary and the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) feeds. These repositories are widely used in Vulnerability Management Systems (VMSs) to check for known vulnerabilities in software products. The analysis shows, among other issues, a lack of synchronization between both datasets that can lead to incorrect results output by VMSs relying on those datasets. To deal with these problems, we developed a method that recommends to a user a prioritized list of CPE identifiers for a given software product. The user can then assign (and, if necessary, adapt) the most suitable CPE identifier to the software so that regular (e.g., daily) checks can find known vulnerabilities for this software in the CVE feeds. Our evaluation of this method shows that this interaction is indeed necessary because a fully automated CPE assignment is prone to errors due to the CPE and CVE shortcomings. We implemented an open-source VMS that employs the proposed method and published it on GitHub.},

    abstractNote = {The number of new vulnerabilities continues to rise significantly each year. Simultaneously, vulnerability databases have challenges in promptly sharing new security events with enough information to improve protections against emerging cyberattack vectors and possible exploits. In this context, several organizations adopt strategies to protect their data, technologies, and infrastructures from cyberattacks by implementing anticipatory and proactive approaches to their system security activities. To this end, vulnerability management systems play a crucial role in mitigating the impact of cyberattacks by identifying potential vulnerabilities within an organization and alerting cyber teams. However, the effectiveness of these systems, which employ multiple methods and techniques to identify weaknesses, relies heavily on the accuracy of published security events. For this reason, we introduce a discussion concerning existing vulnerability detection methods through an in-depth literature study of several research papers. Based on the results, this paper points out some issues related to vulnerability databases handling that impact the effectiveness of certain vulnerability identification methods. Furthermore, after summarizing the existing methodologies, this study classifies them into four approaches and discusses the challenges, findings, and potential research directions.},

Known vulnerabilities are listed in the open databases. It is essential to continuously monitor that information system doesn’t contain severe vulnerabilities to ensure its information security. Applicability of open vulnerability databases is limited by the challenges occurring due to automated mapping the software product names in the analyzed system logs to their product names in the open sources (to extract relevant vulnerabilities from them). The paper proposes the technique incorporating an algorithm for mapping the software products names in the analyzed system logs to the relevant Common Platform Enumeration entries in open vulnerability databases based on the Ratcliff/Obershelp algorithm, identification of known vulnerabilities for the detected entries, and security risk assessment of the analysed system. The technique is implemented and tested using Windows computers software and has shown an accuracy of 79% on average.},

However, this can be a considerable burden because their resources are often limited. This paper introduces a technique and system architecture that monitor the vulnerability of the IT assets on an organization’s administrative networks. We use open information and standardized, non-proprietary tools in order to bolster cybersecurity capability for a wide range of organizations. In the proposed system, an agent module installed on each IT asset sends information to its server, while the server also probes the network to collect information on agentless IT assets. The server then converts the information into standard identifiers, which are used to query open repositories to obtain vulnerability information. The system provides an alert when vulnerability information pertaining to the IT asset is identified. This paper also introduces a prototype system, with which we analyze and discuss the proposed technique and system and clarify issues to be solved in our future work.}
